@title[Intro]
> Python is a multi-paradigm programming language: object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, 
> and many language features support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming (including by metaprogramming
> and metaobjects (magic methods)).

> Python uses dynamic typing and a mix of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management.
> An important feature of Python is dynamic name resolution (late binding), which binds method and variable names during
> program execution.
