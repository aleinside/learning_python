>>> word = "python"

'Py'
>>> word[2:5]  # characters from position 2 (included) to 5 (excluded)
'tho'
Note how the start is always included, and the end always excluded. This makes sure that s[:i] + s[i:] is always equal to s:

>>>
>>> word[:2] + word[2:]
'Python'
>>> word[:4] + word[4:]
'Python'
Slice indices have useful defaults; an omitted first index defaults to zero, an omitted second index defaults to the size of the string being sliced.

>>>
>>> word[:2]   # character from the beginning to position 2 (excluded)
'Py'
>>> word[4:]   # characters from position 4 (included) to the end
'on'
>>> word[-2:]  # characters from the second-last (included) to the end
'on'
```

>>> words
['defenestrate', 'cat', 'window', 'defenestrate']
With for w in words:, the example would attempt to create an infinite list, inserting defenestrate over and over again.

## Liste

class Dog:

    tricks = []             # mistaken use of a class variable

    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def add_trick(self, trick):
        self.tricks.append(trick)

>>> d = Dog('Fido')
>>> e = Dog('Buddy')
>>> d.add_trick('roll over')
>>> e.add_trick('play dead')
>>> d.tricks                # unexpectedly shared by all dogs
['roll over', 'play dead']
Correct design of the class should use an instance variable instead:

class Dog:

    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.tricks = []    # creates a new empty list for each dog

    def add_trick(self, trick):
        self.tricks.append(trick)

>>> d = Dog('Fido')
>>> e = Dog('Buddy')
>>> d.add_trick('roll over')
>>> e.add_trick('play dead')
>>> d.tricks
['roll over']
>>> e.tricks
['play dead']
